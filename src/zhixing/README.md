### Project Structure ###

The `src/zhixing` package contains three sub-packages: `cpxInd`, `djss`, and `symbolicregression`. Specifically, `cpxInd` defines the algorithms and their necessary functions (or interface), including basic LGP, and its advanced variants. It decouples the algorithm implementation from problems. `djss` defines the application of LGP and its variants to dynamic job shop scheduling problems. `symbolicregression` mainly implements the algorithms for symbolic regression.

For a more detailed introduction to the packages, please check the readme in the three sub-packages.
