part of "simpleLGP_symbolicregression_distance.params" and "simpleLGP_symbolicregression_mexicanhat.params" are updated. "simpleLGP_symbolicregression_doubleSin.params" is not updated. Since these three problems (and their corresponding params files) use the "ec.app.tutorial4.DoubleData", which cannot convert into "yimei.jss.gp.data.DoubleData", these three params file cannot run after the my ECJ framework upgrade (2023.12.2).
