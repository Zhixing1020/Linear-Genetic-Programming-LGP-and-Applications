# Graph-based Seach Mechanisms in LGP for Symbolic Regression #

### Project Structure ###

**`graphbased/individual`**

This sub-package implements the necessary classes of graph-based search mechanisms in LGP for symbolic regression. (see [graph-based LGP](../../../cpxInd/algorithm/Graphbased)).

### Running Examples ###

ðŸ©¹ There are no examples for these classes now. They are mainly the compared methods for other advanced algorithms. We can build the parameter file by:

1. replacing the individual with `individual/LGPindividual4GraphSR`.
2. replacing the genetic operators with the graph-based genetic operators in `individual/reproduce`.
