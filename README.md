# Linear Genetic Programming and Applications
This project implements the basic linear genetic programming and some of its advanced variants. The project decouples the algorithm implementations and problem applications, which facilitate the application to other domains. In this project, we apply linear genetic programming to dynamic job shop scheduling and symbolic regression, respectively.
